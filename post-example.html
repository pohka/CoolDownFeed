        <p>I was working on a couple projects in the past few weeks. But now I'm currently participating in the Frostivus competition so a lot of my time is going towards that. This is the current status of my projects:</p>
        <h2>Frostivus Game</h2>
        <p>My main priority is getting this finished and polished before the deadline of Nov 20th. For anyone who doesn't know Valve have announced a competition which they pick a newly created Frostivus custom game from the community and the winner get $30k. My custom game is going to be a cooperative RPG with non-linear progression. That means it will have boss fights, quests, traps, puzzles and the key focuses is replayability. The enemies will match the player levels and will spawn in random orders so each play through is not the same.</p>
        <div class="post-img">

        </div>
        <p>There is a concept in Final Fantasy XIII: Lightning Returns called Paradigm Shift which allows you to switch between classes quickly during combat. I am planning on implementing a similar system but instead you get to switch out all your basic abilities. So each player will have 3 class, each class is essential the hero abilities from heroes in the Dota. So you could toggle between Juggernaut, Pudge and Windrangers basic abilities in quick time combat.</p>
        <div class="quote">Lightning Returns called Paradigm Shift which allows you to switch between classes</div>
        <p>I will be doing test in a couple of weeks in the beta version, so if anyone wants to try it out I will be announcing it on my twitter. Another priority to this project is polish it and making promotional content because I want it to look professional. If I can reach the level of polish from my old custom game Phantom Palace, I will be happy.</p>
        <h2>Infographic Creator</h2>
        <p>Making infographics takes an enormous amount of time and with 25+ tournaments in the next 12 months I need a better solution to make infographics. Originally I had been using an image editor to create them which took 7-9 hours to make. I currently have a working tool which was used to make the TI7 team infographics and a few others. Which proved to be a valuable tool as it reduced the creation time down to 45-60mins.</p>
        <div class="post-img">
          <img src="/temp/infog.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>But I need to redesign the entire tool because of a poor design in the back end. The new tool will also be more aesthetically pleasing and have more features than the old version. The goal of this project is to make infographics that are more interactive and not just a static image. It will also mean I can release different types of infographics such as monthly heroes.</p>
